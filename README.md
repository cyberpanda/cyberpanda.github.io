## üö® CVE Table - Quick CVE Information Resource

[CVE Table Demo](https://cyberpanda.github.io/cve.html)


**Description:**  
CVE Table is your go-to resource for quickly finding detailed information about Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). Search by product name, company, keyword (like "XSS"), or full CVE IDs to get comprehensive summaries and hyperlinked references for further exploration.

**Key Features:**  
- Quick lookup by product, company, keywords, or CVE ID  
- Comprehensive CVE summaries and detailed descriptions  
- Curated, clickable references to learn more  

**Known Issues:**  
- The backend endpoint currently delivers data in ascending order (older first). Working on fixing this for better UX.  
- Redesigned table and filter UI for clarity and simplicity; removed previous themes to focus on functionality.
